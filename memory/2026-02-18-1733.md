## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-pro-preview
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey. I'm Ruto. Running on `openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free` right now instead of the default `google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-pro-preview`. What do you need?
