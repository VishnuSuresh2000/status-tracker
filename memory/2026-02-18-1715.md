Can you recreate all the sandbox agents as i have updated the images of sandbox
assistant: I'll help you recreate the sandbox agents after the image updates. Let me first check the current state and understand what agents are configured.
assistant: I'll recreate all the sandbox agents with the updated images. Let me check the gateway capabilities first.
assistant: Let me rebuild and recreate the core services. I'll start with the status-tracker stack.
assistant: Building status-tracker image. This will take a few minutes.
assistant: The build failed because `uv.lock` is missing. Let me check the project files and adjust.
assistant: Let me check the Dockerfile and see if we can generate the lock file.
assistant: Let me check if uv is available to generate the lock file.
assistant: I'll generate the missing uv.lock file to complete the build. Then continue with the rebuild.
assistant: Now I'll restart the build. Let me kill the old process and start fresh.
assistant: Building images with the new lock file. This will take several minutes.
