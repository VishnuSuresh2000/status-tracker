## Conversation Summary

user: [Tue 2026-02-10 23:00 GMT+5:30] how i setup google email and other google ppas
[message_id: 373e87f4-7f0b-49b1-9e07-781a42b21b1f]
assistant: Clarify what you need:

1. **Gmail API** - OAuth access to read/send emails via Python?
2. **Google Cloud SDK** - Install `gcloud` CLI via apt PPA?
3. **Google OAuth** - Auth flow for any Google service (Drive, Sheets, etc.)?
4. **Google Photos API** - Access to download/sync photos?

Give me a specific goal and I'll help you set it up.
user: [Tue 2026-02-10 23:01 GMT+5:30] do you have a skill for it?
[message_id: d600a527-1412-46df-8bd2-391a5fec6e8e]
assistant: No dedicated skill for Google APIs, but I can help you set it up. I have a couple of options:

1. **Check for MCP servers** - Use `mcporter` to see if there's a Google MCP server available
2. **Manual setup** - I can walk you through the Google Cloud Console OAuth setup and Python code

Want me to check for MCP servers first, or just jump into setting up Gmail API access?
user: [Tue 2026-02-10 23:03 GMT+5:30] how to set up the gog skill
[message_id: 9952a0cf-18ef-4718-9b47-9a16286b901b]
assistant: You mean the **GitHub** skill (`gh` CLI). Let me check the setup instructions.

assistant: To set up the GitHub skill:

**1. Install the `gh` CLI:**
```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

**2. Authenticate with GitHub:**
```bash
gh auth login
```
Follow the prompts (browser auth recommended).

That's it — you'll have full GitHub access via `gh issue`, `gh pr`, `gh run`, etc.

**1. Install gog CLI (Go-based):**
```bash
# Via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install steipete/tap/gogcli

# Or via Go install
go install github.com/steipete/gogcli@latest
```

**2. Set up OAuth credentials:**
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a project → Enable APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.)
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
- Download `credentials.json`

**3. Authenticate:**
```bash
gog auth add you@gmail.com
```

**4. Install the Claude skill:**
```bash
# Clone the skill
git clone https://github.com/mjfork/mjfork-claude-plugins.git
# Copy skill to your skills directory
cp mjfork-claude-plugins/skills/gog /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gog
```

Want me to help with the Google Cloud Console OAuth setup?
