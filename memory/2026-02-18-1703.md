assistant: Hey DoCZ. Ruto here — direct, capable, a little dry. Running on a non-default model today (step-3.5-flash), but I'll get it done. What do you want to do?

Ruto can you check the openclaw have been updated or not
assistant: OpenClaw version: **2026.2.15** (last touched Feb 18, 2026).

The gateway daemon is currently down (device token mismatch), so I can't check if a newer version is available. If you want, I can try restarting the gateway to restore connectivity and then check for updates.
