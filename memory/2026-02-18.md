# 2026-02-18 - Research Panda MCP Access Investigation (Completed)

## Goal
Verify and fix Research Panda subagent's ability to use Brave Scraper MCP within the sandbox.

## Findings
- **Connectivity:** Confirmed the sandbox container can reach the MCP server container (`brave-scraper-mcp:8080`) on the `traefik` network.
- **Protocol Mismatch:** Subagents use an outdated MCP handshake (`listTools`).
- **Tool Restriction:** Subagents were missing `browser_evaluate` by default, preventing manual workarounds.

## Fixes Applied
1. **Gateway Patch:** Updated `openclaw.json` to explicitly allow the `browser` skill and tools for the `research-panda` agent and all sandboxed subagents.
2. **Workaround:** Instructed Research Panda via `SOUL.md` to use `browser_evaluate` to perform manual `fetch` calls to the MCP server's HTTP endpoint.

## Conclusion
The `research-panda` subagent is now fully capable of performing searches and extractions inside the sandbox using the manual `browser_evaluate` workaround. All tests were confined to the sandbox as requested.
