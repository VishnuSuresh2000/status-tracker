## Status Tracker UI Enhancements Complete

### Phase 9 - UI Skill & Flowchart (Commit: e3866f3)
- Fixed Mermaid.js flowchart rendering with `mermaid.render()` + unique IDs
- Standardized skill bubbles with `rounded-full` styling
- Split skills into Agent Skills (indigo, `agent:` prefix) and Task Skills (amber, `task:` prefix)
- Added `parseSkills()` and `combineSkills()` helper functions

### Phase 10 - UI Enhancements & Testing (Commit: a7813cc)
- Added Mermaid zoom controls (+/-/Reset) with `zoomMermaid()` and `resetMermaidZoom()`
- Implemented lazy loading for completed tasks (5 at a time with "Load More" button)
- Fixed mobile responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Created `tests/test_ui_enhancements.py` (18 unit tests)
- Created `tests/test_ui_playwright_enhancements.py` (Playwright UI tests)
- **176 tests passing**

### Technical Notes
- Opencode CLI (v1.1.49) was slow/unresponsive in pty mode - had to manually implement zoom controls
- Sub-agent spawned to help but couldn't access host files due to sandbox isolation
- Direct `edit` tool worked well for targeted changes
- Worker container needs `--build` for code changes (baked into image, not volume-mounted)

### CI Status
- All commits passed CI with green builds
- UI tests excluded from CI (require running server)
