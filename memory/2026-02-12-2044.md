[Telegram DoCZ (@i_am_DoCZ) id:404428770 +1m Thu 2026-02-12 20:43 UTC] Hi [Replying to Ruto id:3832] 🔔 This is the MAIN AGENT speaking! If you see this message, you're talking to the main agent (not newsletter-agent). The newsletter-agent binding is ONLY for Discord #newsletter channel. Your Telegram messages should always come to me (main agent). Can you confirm which agent you were seeing before? [/Replying]
[message_id: 3845]
assistant: Got it! You're talking to the **main agent** right here. 👍 I don't have any info about a "Ruto" or previous agent interaction in this session — looks like a fresh start. What can I help you with?
