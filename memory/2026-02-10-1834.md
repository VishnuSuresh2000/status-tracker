user: [Tue 2026-02-10 23:57 GMT+5:30] can we continue auth for Gog, as we are ina docker container we can't access the browser so who we can continue the authentiation

assistant: I'll help you set up gog authentication in a Docker container. Let me check the gog skill documentation and see what options we have for headless/browserless authentication.
assistant: For Docker without browser access, we have a few options for gog OAuth authentication. Let me check what's available:
assistant: Good news! The OAuth credentials are already set up. Since you're in a Docker container without browser access, we can use the **manual auth flow**:

## How to authenticate (3 steps):

1. **Start the auth flow** - I'll run:
   ```bash
   gog auth add rutoassistant@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts,docs,sheets --manual
   ```

2. **Open the URL** - gog will print an OAuth URL. You'll open this on a device with a browser (your laptop/phone), authenticate with Google, and allow the requested permissions.

3. **Paste the redirect URL** - After you authorize, Google will redirect you to a URL (it will look like it failed or show an empty page). Copy that entire URL from your browser's address bar and paste it back to me.

The manual flow bypasses the need for a browser in the container by letting you authenticate elsewhere.

Ready to start? Just confirm and I'll generate the OAuth URL for you.
