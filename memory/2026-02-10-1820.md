assistant: I see you've received a Google OAuth2 callback URL. This is part of the `gog` (Google Workspace CLI) authentication flow. Let me check the skill documentation to see how to process this callback.
assistant: I see you've received a Google OAuth2 callback URL. This happens during the `gog` authentication flow. The URL you have is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:39961/oauth2/callback?state=...&code=...
```

**What's happening:** You clicked "Authorize" in the Google consent screen, and Google is redirecting to the local server that `gog` started to receive the authorization code.

**The problem:** The local server on port 39961 might not be running anymore (it may have timed out or been stopped).

**To fix this, you need to:**

1. **Start the gog auth flow again** in a terminal:
   ```bash
   gog auth add rutoassistant@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts,docs,sheets
   ```

2. **Keep that terminal open** - it will start a local server and print a URL to visit

3. **Open the URL** in your browser when prompted

4. **Click "Authorize"** - this time the server will still be running to receive the callback

5. **You should see a success message** in the terminal

The OAuth callback is time-sensitive and requires the `gog auth add` command to be actively running when you complete the authorization in the browser.

Would you like me to help you check if gog is already authenticated or walk you through the setup process?
