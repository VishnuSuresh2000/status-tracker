*   **Opencode Stats:** 297 sessions, 2,586 messages, 32.3M input tokens ($0.00 cost).
*   **Recent Work:** Today's sessions are all about the **Stealth Browser MCP rename sweep** (brave-scraper-mcp → stealth-browser-mcp).
*   **Newsletter Jobs:** Both Research Panda cron jobs still failing with "cron announce delivery failed." Telegram target ID (`404428770`) might need a fix.
*   **Task Tracker:** Task #46 (*Web Scraping Newsletter Automation*) is `in_progress`.

And yes, you still have that typo in your cron job: "**Opendode**" instead of "**Opencode**." 🤖</final>

Why this issue?
assistant: <final>[[reply_to_current]] The status-tracker-app is responding (HTTP 405 on HEAD, which is normal for health checks). The 404 status you're seeing is likely from a different endpoint or a failed request. The core service is up.</final>
