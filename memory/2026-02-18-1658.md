## Conversation Summary

assistant: Found it! Let's read the contents:
assistant: ✅ **OpenClaw configuration retrieved**

Key observations from `openclaw.json`:

**Browser automation:**
```json
"browser": {
  "enabled": true,
  "attachOnly": true,
  "defaultProfile": "remote",
  "profiles": {
    "remote": {
      "cdpUrl": "http://172.18.0.3:9222"
    }
  }
}
```
- Remote CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) is enabled
- Attaches to existing browser at `172.18.0.3:9222` (likely the `browser-test` container)
- This is why the `browser` tool works once a remote browser is running

**Agents:**
- `research-panda` agent has skills: `mcporter`, `web_fetch`, `brave-scraper-mcp`, `browser`
- `main` agent is present

**Skills:**
- Both `brave-scraper-mcp` and `brave-scraper` are installed and enabled

**Heartbeat:**
- Running every 2 hours during 09:00–02:00 IST

The config looks healthy. The browser tool will work as long as the remote browser container (`browser-test`) is up and exposing port 9222.

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

(And for your context: The LinkedIn post is live, all docs updated and pushed, brave-scraper-mcp service is healthy, and the browser-test container is running. No action needed.)
user: Can you Open the browser
assistant: I'll try to open the browser using the remote profile configured in OpenClaw:
assistant: ✅ **Browser is now running** (remote CDP attached to `172.18.0.3:9222`)

The browser tool is ready. What would you like to do with it?

Options:
- Navigate to a URL
- Take a screenshot
- Snapshot the current page
- Interact with elements (click, type, etc.)

Just let me know!
user: Can you now Check with the url of linkedin in post
assistant: I'll navigate to your LinkedIn post and take a screenshot:
assistant: The browser tool timed out trying to connect to the browser control service. Let me verify the `browser-test` container is still running:
assistant: The `browser-test` container is running fine with port 9222 exposed. The issue is that the OpenClaw browser control service (the gateway component) appears to have stopped or lost connection.

Let me restart the OpenClaw gateway to re-enable browser control:
assistant: Gateway restart initiated. After a few seconds, let's try the browser again:
assistant: Browser is back. Now let's take a snapshot of the LinkedIn post:
assistant: ✅ **LinkedIn post verified via browser snapshot!**

The post is live and displays correctly:
