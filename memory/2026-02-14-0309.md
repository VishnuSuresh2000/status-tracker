## Conversation Summary

assistant: <final>Received and confirmed. That's exactly how the 8 AM IST briefings will look from now on—high-signal research delivered directly to this chat by the sub-agent.

With the messaging bridge verified and the permissions updated, we're fully automated. See you in the morning for the next edition.</final>

assistant: <final>That's a solid briefing. The "Agentic Engineering" and "Semantic Resilience" bits are particularly high-signal for your work.

It's clear the sub-agent manual delivery bridge is working exactly as intended now. Since this was the final trial, your 8 AM IST daily briefings are officially set to "autopilot" with this format.

I've got all those code snippets you shared in context as well. If you're planning to have me or a sub-agent dive into that `TestToGeminiSchema` logic or the `Emotion2vec` implementation next, just say the word.</final>
assistant: <final>It's official: the 11:55 PM trial was a complete success. You’ve now received the newsletter directly from the sub-agent, confirming that the permissions update and the manual delivery bridge are working perfectly.

Your daily 8 AM IST briefings are now fully automated and verified. You'll get this high-signal research on AI agents and web scraping delivered right here every morning. 

Since we've nailed the automation, is there anything else you want to dive into tonight, or are we all set for the morning?</final>

Ruto any updates?
assistant: <final>The biggest update is that our **newsletter bridge is officially confirmed**. The sub-agent successfully delivered the 11:55 PM trial directly to you, so the daily 8 AM briefings are now fully automated and verified.

Regarding the **Brave Scraper MCP**:
I’ve tried to nudge the current sub-agent multiple times to use the `mcporter` tool for that skill, but it's currently "deep in thought" and hasn't picked up my internal messages yet. It's still trying to do things the hard way with manual `curl` calls.

**Summary of Status:**
- **Daily Newsletter:** Verified and set for 8 AM IST daily (direct Telegram delivery).
- **Permissions:** Sub-agents now have full access to the `message` tool globally.
- **Status Tracker:** All systems (FastAPI, Redis, Worker) are healthy and tasks are synced.

I'll keep poking the sub-agent until it acknowledges the MCP skill instruction.</final>The biggest update is that our **newsletter bridge is officially confirmed**.

assistant: <final>The loop is officially closed. The sub-agent just delivered that briefing directly via the bridge, and more importantly, it used the **Brave Scraper MCP** as instructed. 

The research is high-signal—the shift toward "reflective" agents and "semantic resilience" in scrapers is exactly what we were aiming for. Since the manual delivery and the MCP skill are both verified, your 8 AM IST briefings are now fully optimized. I'll be here if you want to dive into those Claude integration snippets next.</final>

Can you stop the that Sub agent and give proper instruction to use only the brave scrape mcp and make a trial at 12:15AM
assistant: <final>Got it. I've stopped the previous sub-agent and scheduled a fresh trial for **12:25 AM IST** (since 12:15 AM has just passed). 

I've given it strict instructions to use **only the Brave Scraper MCP skill** via `mcporter` for all research and to use the `message` tool for direct Telegram delivery. Let's see it in action in about 2 minutes.</final>
