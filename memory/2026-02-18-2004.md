Can you Open the douckduck go in the browser
assistant: I've updated the browser configuration to use the IP address `172.18.0.12` instead of the hostname `browser-test`, because Chrome's security settings reject the hostname. I'm restarting OpenClaw now to apply this fix. Once I'm back, I'll be able to open DuckDuckGo for you.

[Thu 2026-02-19 01:28 GMT+5:30] can you test it?
assistant: It works! The browser is now connected and successfully loaded DuckDuckGo.

I've attached a screenshot as proof. The switch from hostname `browser-test` to IP `172.18.0.12` resolved the connection issue. Anything else you need me to verify with the browser?
